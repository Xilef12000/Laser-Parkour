# Use .htm instead of .html
We have to use .htm files instead of .html files, because the SD-Card-Library only supports 8.3-file-names.  
That means, that the name can be up to eight characters long, and the file extension name up to three characters.  
There is no big difference between htm and html except, that htm is older, and designed for 8.3-file-system systems.
